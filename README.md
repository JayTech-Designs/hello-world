# hello-world

Hey there, I'm James Udotong, the CEO of JayTech Designs, I'm a freelancer graphics designer who has interest in coding.
I've been designing for about 2yrs now and have been coding for about a year. 
I'm into python programming language and Dart for flutter app development.
The reason why I decided to go into coding and specifically python is because I want to know how to use AI to solve real life problems
around me and my community and to be able to generate income from it. üòÅ‚úå
